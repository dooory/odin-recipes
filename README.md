This was my first completed TOP project!

This is a website that holds some easy cooking and baking recipes that anyone can follow!

Through this project I've gained experience with using git over the command-line, working on writing clear and concise commit messages, when to commit/push, viewing logs, and using diff to compare file versions. I've also used this project to work on my HTML skills, specifically, tags covered in the previous lessons, such as headers, images, paragraphs, anchors; creating boilerplates, formatting my code, and consistency.

I am looking forward to continuing my TOP journey :)
