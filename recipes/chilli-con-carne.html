            <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven grill to 200°C/high. Set aside a large casserole/baking dish (if you do not have an oven proof frying pan).</li>
                <li>Combine all rice ingredients in a medium-sized lidded pot and bring to the boil. As soon as it boils, cover with a tight-fitting lid and reduce to lowest heat to cook for 12 minutes. Turn off heat and leave to steam, still covered, for a further 8 minutes. Do not lift lid during cooking or steaming. When rice has finished steaming, fluff up grains with a fork.</li>
                <li>Heat a little oil in a large frying pan (preferably oven-proof) on a high heat.Cook beef mince and onion, breaking up mince with a wooden spoon as it cooks, for 7-8 minute, until browned. Add chilli spice mix (see recipe below) and chilli flakes/powder (if using) and cook for a further 1 minutes, until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add corn, beans, tomato paste, canned tomatoes, carrot and stock to pan. Bring to a summer then reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 9-12 minutes, until thickened. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                <li>While sauce is simmering, prepare the rest of the meal. In a small bowl, combine sour cream and tomato sauce and set aside. Thinly slice lettuce and place in a serving bowl.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle cheese over mince and place whole pan under grill for about 6 minutes, until cheese is bubbling and golden. If you don’t have an oven-proof frying pan, transfer mixture to an oven-proof dish before adding the cheese.</li>
                <li>To serve, place Chilli Con Carne, rice, tomato sour cream and lettuce in the middle of the table for everyone to help themselves.</li>
