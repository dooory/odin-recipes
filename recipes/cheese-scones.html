            <li>Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Add cheese, cayenne pepper and mustard powder to the mixture. Rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Add the milk and quickly mix with a round-bladed table knife to a soft dough. For light and tender scones the mixture should be quite soft and a little sticky. Scrape the dough onto the floured baking tray and flour the top.</li>
